  - title: When the DM would traditionally ask a player to roll a d20 without modifiers to determine an outcome, and binary outcomes are expected.
    description: |
      Many times in a campaign the outcome of a certain course of action is determined by the roll of a d20, from random encounter tables to even the result of whether or not a character lives or dies in a narrative moment. This method could replace a flat determinant roll for an exciting moment.
