  - title: Rolling With Emphasis
    description: |
      Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll - Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.

      **“Rolling With Emphasis”** is a new mechanic introduced by Brennan Lee Mulligan, where the player is prompted to roll two d20s and take the result furthest away from 10, which increases the likelihood for either a natural 1 or a natural 20.
